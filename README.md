Generates a full GraphQL API using introspection of Mongoid or ActiveRecord models.

## API Dodocumentation
The [API Documentation](https://maxcoto.github.io/graphoid/) that displays how to use the queries and mutations that Graphoid automatically generates.


## Dependency
This gem depends on [the GraphQL gem](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby).
Please install that gem first before continuing

## Installation
Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphoid'
```

```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Database
Create the file `config/initializers/graphoid.rb`
And configure the database you want to use in it (:mongoid or :active_record)

```ruby
Graphoid.configure do |config|
  config.driver = :mongoid
end
```

## Usage
You can determine which models will be visible in the API by including the Graphoid Queries and Mutations concerns

```ruby
class Person
  include Graphoid::Queries
  include Graphoid::Mutations
end
```

## Examples
You can find an example that uses ActiveRecord in the [Tester AR folder](https://github.com/maxiperezc/graphoid/tree/master/spec/tester_ar)  
And an example with Mongoid in the [Tester Mongo folder](https://github.com/maxiperezc/graphoid/tree/master/spec/tester_mongo)  
In this same repository.
